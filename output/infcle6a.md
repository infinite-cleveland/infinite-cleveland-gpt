The 1997 World Series Game 3 between the Florida Marlins and the Cleveland Indians was a rollercoaster of a contest
that went into extra innings, ultimately lasting 11 frames. The Marlins started strong in the top of the 2nd
inning, with Charles Johnson delivering a clutch 2-run home run. However, the Indians answered in the bottom of the
5th, exploding for a remarkable 10 runs. Tony Fernandez, Marquis Grissom, and Omar Vizquel were among the
contributors in this explosive inning. The Marlins, down 10-4, didn't back down. In the top of the 6th, Craig
Counsell and Cliff Floyd each belted solo home runs, sparking a four-run inning. The seesaw battle continued, with
both teams trading blows until the 9th inning, ending with an 11-11 tie. The 10th and 11th innings saw solid
pitching performances on both sides, but neither team managed to break the deadlock. In the end, it was a marathon
of a game filled with dramatic home runs, key defensive plays, and tense moments. The Marlins' resilience and the
Indians' explosive 5th inning were the defining features of this epic World Series clash.
