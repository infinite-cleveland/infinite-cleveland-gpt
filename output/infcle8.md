In a decisive Game 3 of the 1997 World Series between the Florida Marlins and the Cleveland Indians, the Cleveland
Indians dominated from the outset. In the bottom of the 1st inning, the Indians capitalized on Al Leiter's control
issues, loading the bases with walks and then launching into a scoring spree. Jim Thome's sacrifice fly brought in
the first run, and a wild pitch allowed another to score. Manny Ramirez's powerful double and a subsequent grand
slam by Matt D Williams contributed to an explosive 8-run inning. The Marlins struggled against Charles Nagy's
pitching, with only a lone run in the 3rd inning, courtesy of Cliff Floyd's triple. The Indians continued to assert
their dominance, adding more runs in the 2nd and 6th innings. Despite a late attempt by the Marlins in the 9th
inning, the game ended decisively with the Cleveland Indians securing a resounding 12-2 victory in Game 3 of the
1997 World Series.
