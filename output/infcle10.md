In a tense and closely contested matchup in Game 3 of the 1997 World Series between the Florida Marlins and the
Cleveland Indians, both teams struggled to break the deadlock early on. The Marlins took a slim lead in the top of
the second inning, capitalizing on an error and a well-executed steal. Despite solid pitching from Al Leiter for
the Marlins and Charles Nagy for the Indians, the game remained a pitcher's duel. However, in the top of the fifth
inning, the Marlins threatened to extend their lead with runners in scoring position, but the Indians managed to
escape the jam with a crucial strikeout. The defensive battle continued into the late innings, with both teams
unable to generate significant offense. In the top of the ninth, the Marlins had an opportunity to add insurance
runs, but a spectacular throw from right field to home plate resulted in a runner being tagged out, preserving the
Indians' hopes. Trailing 1-0 in the bottom of the ninth, the Indians mounted a last-ditch effort to tie or win the
game. However, facing the dominant pitching of Robb Nen, the Marlins secured the victory with a strikeout and a
groundout, taking a pivotal Game 3 with a final score of 1-0. The Marlins' strategic baserunning, solid pitching,
and defensive prowess ultimately proved decisive in this low-scoring thriller.
