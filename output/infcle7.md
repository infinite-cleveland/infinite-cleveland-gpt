In a commanding display of offensive prowess, the Cleveland Indians dominated the Florida Marlins in the 1997 World
Series Game 3. The top of the first inning set the tone for the game as Charles Nagy struggled with his control,
issuing multiple walks and allowing two runs for the Marlins. Jim Thome sparked a comeback in the bottom of the
second with a solo home run. The third inning, however, was the turning point. The Indians exploded for an
impressive 10 runs, with key hits including a single by David Justice, a three-run homer by Manny Ramirez, and a
single by Matt D Williams. The offensive onslaught continued in the fifth inning with a three-run home run by Manny
Ramirez. The Marlins managed a solo home run by Bobby Bonilla in the top of the fifth, but it was far from enough.
The game ended with a resounding score of Cleveland 18, Florida 5. The Indians' relentless hitting and impeccable
pitching secured a decisive victory in this memorable World Series matchup.
