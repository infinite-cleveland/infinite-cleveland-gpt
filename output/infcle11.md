In a pivotal Game 3 of the 1997 World Series between the Florida Marlins and the Cleveland Indians, the match began
with a dominating performance by the Indians in the bottom of the 1st inning. Al Leiter struggled on the mound for
the Marlins as Bip Roberts initiated a triple, followed by timely hits from Manny Ramirez, Tony Fernandez, and Matt
D Williams. The Indians quickly secured a 3-0 lead. In the 6th inning, Manny Ramirez added to the Indians'
advantage with a solo home run. However, the Marlins fought back in the 7th with Charles Johnson's single, Devon
White's two-run home run, and Craig Counsell's single. The score tightened to 5-3 in favor of the Indians. The
Marlins made a final push in the 8th, capitalizing on an error and a wild pitch, but the Indians maintained their
narrow lead. Despite a late-game rally by the Marlins, the Indians' solid pitching, highlighted by Paul Assenmacher
and Michael Jackson in the 8th and 9th innings, secured a 5-4 victory, giving them the edge in the series.
