In Game 3 of the 1997 World Series between the Florida Marlins and the Cleveland Indians, the early innings were
characterized by strong pitching performances from both sides. The Indians' Charles Nagy and the Marlins' Al Leiter
showcased their skills, with Leiter fending off threats after a walk and a wild pitch. However, the game took a
turn in the bottom of the second when Manny Ramirez blasted a solo home run, giving Cleveland a 1-0 lead. The
Indians continued to build on their advantage in the fourth inning, capitalizing on an error, a hit by pitch, and a
single, resulting in a 4-0 lead. In the bottom of the fifth, Ramirez and Tony Fernandez delivered crucial hits,
extending Cleveland's lead to 8-0. The Marlins finally got on the board in the sixth with a solo home run by Bobby
Bonilla, making it 8-1. The Indians responded emphatically in the eighth, with a three-run homer by Sandy Alomar
Jr. and a three-run shot by Matt D Williams, sealing a commanding 14-3 lead. Despite a late attempt at a comeback
by the Marlins in the eighth, highlighted by Bonilla's second home run, the Indians' dominant performance secured
them a convincing victory in Game 3 of the World Series.
