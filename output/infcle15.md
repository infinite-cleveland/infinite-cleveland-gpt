In a tense and closely contested Game 3 of the 1997 World Series between the Florida Marlins and the Cleveland
Indians, both teams displayed strong pitching and defensive prowess. The Marlins took an early lead in the top of
the second with Charles Johnson's double, followed by Devon White's RBI double, putting them up 1-0. The Indians,
however, struggled to find their offensive rhythm against Marlins pitcher Al Leiter. The pivotal moment came in the
bottom of the fifth inning when Tony Fernandez's two-run home run and Sandy Alomar Jr.'s solo home run turned the
tide in favor of Cleveland, making it 3-1. Despite the Marlins' efforts, including Edgar Renteria's triple and a
run in the top of the fifth, they couldn't overcome the Indians' lead. Cleveland's strong pitching, particularly
from Charles Nagy, who struck out seven, secured their 3-2 victory in this tightly contested match, putting them
ahead in the series.
